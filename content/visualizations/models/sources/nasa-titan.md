# Titan — NASA Length model

This opaque NASA appearance does not expose a reconstructed global solid surface beneath the atmosphere.

## Processing and calibration

- Calibration: `longest-extent`. The dataset's existing value supplies the physical length; no dataset files were edited.
- Retain original NASA geometry, node transforms, UVs and materials.
- Textures resized to at most 1024 px, JPEG color / PNG alpha and normal maps; no runtime decoder is needed.
- Rebuild: see `scripts/build_space3d_models.py` and `sources/space3d-manifest.json`. Prepared source cache hashes are pinned.

## Verification limits

CPU previews show approximate textured rest/side geometry only. Production WebGL screenshots, projected-size audit and explorer inspection are pending because this sandbox blocks Chromium. See `handoff/space3d/REPORT.md`.
